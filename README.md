# Holistic Electric Powertrain Component Design

## Overview
This simulation tool provides a comprehensive approach for designing electric powertrain components in battery electric vehicles (BEVs) during early development phases. It enables manufacturers to establish initial powertrain component designs that meet specific vehicle concept requirements while minimizing interdependencies between development divisions. The tool encompasses the complete powertrain, including high-voltage battery, power electronics, electric machine, and transmission, serving as a foundation for further development.

The model's simulation results and performance characteristics have been validated against reference vehicles through dynamometer testing and teardown analysis. It is specifically designed to support optimization approaches focusing on energy consumption, which is crucial for BEV design. Through its modular architecture, components can be independently developed and evaluated, helping to avoid time and cost-intensive iterations in the development process.

## Key Features
* Modular powertrain component simulation
